## Project Description
This Python project is a simulation of the solar system, aiming to provide avisualization of the planets' orbits around the Sun. The simulation utilizes real-world values to accurately represent the masses, distances, and movements of the celestial bodies within our solar system. By interactively visualizing the dynamics of the solar system, users can gain a deeper understanding of planetary orbits, gravitational interactions, and other fundamental principles of astronomy.

## Key Features
- Accurate representation of planetary orbits based on real-world data.
- Interactive zoom and pan functionality for exploring the solar system at different scales.
- Adjustable simulation speed to observe planetary motion in real-time or accelerated timeframes.
- Visualization of asteroid belts and other celestial phenomena beyond the major planets.

## Dependencies Required
- Python
- Pygame
- Pygame GUI

## Installation & Running
Before running our program, ensure the required dependecies are installed. Simply run:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 or
 ```
 pip install Pygame
 pip install pygame-gui
 ```
Following this, running main.py will execute our code.
